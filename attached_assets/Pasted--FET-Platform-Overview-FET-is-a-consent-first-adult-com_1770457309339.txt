# FET Platform

## Overview
FET is a **consent-first adult community and creator platform** designed for fetish-positive spaces that prioritize safety, autonomy, and compliance — without killing creativity or community.

This project started as a proof of concept and is being built incrementally with a **mobile-first mindset**, currently developed and tested inside Replit.

---

## Core Philosophy
- **Consent-first**: Visibility, interaction, and access are intentional.
- **Creator-first**: Creators control how, when, and where content appears.
- **Adult-positive**: Fetish-friendly without becoming a low-effort content dump.
- **Safety-aware**: Moderation and compliance are built-in, not bolted on later.
- **Scalable by design**: What starts simple can grow into a full platform.

## Target Audience
- Adult creators
- Fetish communities
- Sex-positive users
- Moderators and admins managing adult spaces
- Mobile-first users (Android/iOS)
