MVP HARDENING CHECKLIST
(Before inviting real creators or accepting real money)
1. NON-NEGOTIABLES (Do Not Ship Without These)
These are not “nice to have.” Skipping them creates legal, safety, or payment-processor failure risk.
1.1 Clear Platform Role Definition (CRITICAL)
You must explicitly define what you are — and are not.
You are:
A marketplace / listing platform
A payment facilitator
A messaging intermediary
You are NOT:
A producer of content
A participant in in-person services
An employer or agent of creators
Action:
Add a short, plain-language Platform Role Disclosure
Shown at creator signup
Linked in footer
Referenced at checkout for in-person bookings
This protects you legally and helps with Stripe reviews.
1.2 Creator Legal Self-Attestation
Before a creator can publish services or receive payments, require explicit confirmation that:
They are 18+
They own the rights to all content sold
Their services comply with local laws
No third parties appear without consent
Action:
Checkbox + timestamp + IP log
Store acceptance version (v1, v2, etc.)
This is lightweight but powerful if anything goes wrong.
1.3 Payment Flow Guardrails (Stripe Survival Layer)
Stripe is your choke point.
Do immediately:
Separate:
Buyer payment
Platform fee (15%)
Creator payout (escrow-style if possible)
Add delayed payout (e.g., 24–72h) for dispute handling
Block payouts until:
Creator profile complete
Legal attestation accepted
Do NOT:
Let creators withdraw instantly
Describe in-person services as “sex acts” anywhere in metadata
Use neutral language: session, booking, appearance, time-based service.
1.4 Age Gate Enforcement Consistency
You already did this well — just ensure:
Age gate is enforced server-side, not only UI
Deep links still trigger verification
Session persistence expires reasonably
This matters if regulators or hosts review logs.
2. HIGH-RISK FEATURES THAT NEED CONSTRAINTS (Not Removal)
These features are fine — but only with rails.
2.1 In-Person Session Safety Wrapper
Treat this as your riskiest MVP feature.
Minimum viable safety layer:
No exact addresses stored or shown
Location field = city / area only
Mandatory acknowledgment:
“Platform does not supervise or verify in-person interactions”
Creator controls:
Availability windows
Cancellation buffer
Manual confirmation option (approve before booking)
Optional but strong:
Auto-expire unpaid bookings
Cooling-off period before confirmation
2.2 Messaging System Guardrails
You have moderation — now add user-visible boundaries.
Add immediately:
“Report” button on messages
System warning when a message is blocked (not silent fail)
Creator option: “Auto-block buyers after X violations”
This reduces support load later.
3. WHAT TO LOCK INTO DOCUMENTATION NOW
These are decisions, not features.
3.1 Service Taxonomy (Lock This Early)
Your current service types are good. Lock them.
Example:
Custom content (asynchronous)
Digital content bundles
Live video calls
Time-based in-person bookings
Why it matters:
Affects UI
Affects moderation
Affects legal classification
Avoid letting creators invent free-text service types for now.
3.2 Platform Fee Philosophy
Document:
15% platform fee (why)
Stripe fees passed through
Refund handling logic
This prevents creator backlash later when scale begins.
3.3 Moderation Authority
Define:
What triggers removal
Who decides
Appeal process (even if manual)
Even a simple rule like:
“Platform may suspend accounts at its discretion for safety or compliance reasons.”
…is better than nothing.
