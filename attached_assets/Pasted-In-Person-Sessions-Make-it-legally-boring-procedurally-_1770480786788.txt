In-Person Sessions
Make it legally boring, procedurally safe, and unattractive to bad actors
Your goal is not to make this “safe” in an absolute sense — that’s impossible.
Your goal is to make it clearly not your responsibility while still usable.
1. Reframe What the Platform Is Doing (Language Matters)
Never describe this as facilitating an encounter.
Use this framing everywhere (UI, DB fields, emails):
“The platform enables time-based availability listings and booking requests between independent parties.”
Avoid terms like:
meet
hookup
escort
sexual service
Prefer:
session
appearance
booking
time-based service
availability window
This matters for:
Stripe reviews
Hosting providers
Law enforcement inquiries
2. Booking Flow (Minimum Liability Version)
Step-by-Step Safe Flow
Creator lists availability
Time window
City / general area only
Price per time unit
Optional notes (non-explicit)
Buyer submits booking request
Selects time window
Pays platform-held funds (not instant payout)
Accepts disclaimer
Creator manually confirms
No auto-confirm
Can decline without reason
Can suggest alternate time
Platform releases funds after delay
Only after session time passes
With dispute window
Why manual confirmation matters:
It demonstrates non-automation of real-world interactions.
3. Data Minimization (Huge Win, Low Effort)
Never store:
Exact addresses
Real-time location
Private instructions
Allow:
City
General area (optional free text, length-limited)
Time window
If someone demands address exchange → that happens off-platform, not logged.
4. Mandatory Safety & Liability Acknowledgment
At booking confirmation, require explicit acceptance:
“The platform does not supervise, verify, or participate in in-person sessions.
All interactions occur independently between users.”
Log:
User ID
Timestamp
IP
Disclaimer version
This protects you more than any fancy feature.
5. Stripe-Protective Metadata Strategy
Stripe will inspect metadata.
Safe fields:
service_type: time_based_booking
duration_minutes
city
booking_id
Avoid storing or transmitting:
Descriptions of activities
Messages inside payment objects
Keep payments boring.
6. Emergency Kill Switch (Add This Now)
You need a one-click global disable:
“Pause in-person bookings”
Reasons:
Stripe inquiry
Legal concern
Safety incident
This should:
Hide service type
Prevent new bookings
Leave historical data intact
This is a maturity signal.
