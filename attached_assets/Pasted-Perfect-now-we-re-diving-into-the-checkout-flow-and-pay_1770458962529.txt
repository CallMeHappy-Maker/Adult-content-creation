Perfect — now we’re diving into the checkout flow and payment breakdown. Since your platform is focused on custom content requests (for now), let’s carefully design a fast, safe, and logical payment structure so both creators and the platform benefit.
1️⃣ Checkout Flow Overview
Here’s the ideal user journey:
Customer side:
Browse creators or select a creator from the feed.
Click “Request Custom Content”.
Fill out the request form:
Text description of what they want
Optional reference images/videos
Optional urgency / delivery speed
See total cost breakdown:
Creator fee
Platform fee (optional percentage)
Taxes or processing fees (if applicable)
Pay via Stripe/PayPal checkout.
See confirmation and wait for the creator to post the content.
Creator side:
Receive notification of a new paid request.
Create and post the requested content privately for the customer.
Platform confirms delivery (optional).
Creator balance is updated; payout occurs via Stripe Connect or PayPal.
2️⃣ Payment Breakdown
We need to structure who gets what clearly:
Item
Who receives
Notes
Creator fee
Creator
Base price for content
Platform fee
Platform
Percentage of creator fee (e.g., 10-20%)
Payment processor fee
Stripe/PayPal
Typically 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction
Total charged to user
Customer
Creator fee + platform fee + processor fee
Example Calculation:
Creator fee: $20
Platform fee: 15% → $3
Stripe fee: $0.94 (2.9% + $0.30)
Customer pays: $20 + $3 + $0.94 ≈ $23.94
Creator receives: $20 - $0.94 ≈ $19.06
Platform receives: $3
3️⃣ Front-End Checkout UI
You’ll need a breakdown table before payment:
Copy code
Html
<div id="checkout">
  <h3>Request Summary</h3>
  <p>Creator: Alice</p>
  <p>Content type: Custom Video</p>
  <p>Creator Fee: $20.00</p>
  <p>Platform Fee: $3.00</p>
  <p>Processing Fee: $0.94</p>
  <hr>
  <p><strong>Total: $23.94</strong></p>
  <button id="pay-btn">Pay Now</button>
</div>
Mobile-friendly: Keep table simple, use cards for each line item.
Button triggers Stripe/PayPal hosted checkout.
4️⃣ Stripe Implementation (Recommended)
Use Stripe Checkout Sessions for simplicity.
Frontend: Redirect user to hosted Stripe page.
Backend: (Optional initially) generate a session for each request.
Example workflow (frontend only):
Copy code
Js
document.getElementById("pay-btn").addEventListener("click", () => {
  const stripeCheckoutLink = "https://buy.stripe.com/test_xyz"; // Replace with creator-specific link
  window.open(stripeCheckoutLink, "_blank");
});
Can generate one Stripe link per creator + request type.
No sensitive card info stored on your platform.
Works immediately on mobile.
5️⃣ Fastest Implementation Plan
Frontend only version:
Show request form + cost breakdown
Use static Stripe/PayPal link per creator
Customer clicks “Pay Now” → Stripe Checkout
Next step with backend (optional for real tracking):
Generate dynamic Stripe session per request
Track request ID, creator ID, and payment confirmation
Unlock content after payment
